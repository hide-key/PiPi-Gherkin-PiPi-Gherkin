PRK Firmware 0.9.13 (20220416 revision bf63c8c)

Welcome to PRK Firmware!

Usage:
- Drag and drop your `keymap.rb` into this directory
- Then, your keyboard will be automatically rebooted. That's all!

Notice:
- Make sure you always have a backup of your `keymap.rb`
  because upgrading prk_firmware-*.uf2 will remove it from flash
